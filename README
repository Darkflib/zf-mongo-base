This is a base class for MongoDB written for Zend Framework models. It is for
use where a model file will be created for a collection in Mongo. It gives an
Active Directory way of manipulating objects.

This class uses late static binding, so PHP 5.3 is required


Installation:

  - Create a directory in your application's Library directory named "Mongo" 
      and place the ModelBase.php file in it.
  - Change the connection settings in ModelBase.php file to match your MongoDB 
      settings.
  - Create a model class that inherits the base class

EXAMPLE USAGE

I created a Visitor model in Zend framework for basic analytics:

  class Model_Visitor extends Mongo_ModelBase {
      // You can set the collection name explicitly, or it will auto generate 
      // by the name of your model (e.g. Model_Visitor would be the 
      // "visitor" collection
      public static $__collectionName = "visitor";
  }

Then when I need to create a new visitor I simply create a new instance 
of my model:

    $myVisitor = new Model_Visitor();
    
    $myVisitor->ipAddress = "55.55.55.55";
    $myVisitor->browser = "Firefox";
    $myVisitor->save();


Use the dot notation to access and set nested elements

These two commands do the same thing:
   $myVisitor->{'referrer.url'} = "www.google.com";
   $myVisitor->referrer = array("url"=>"www.google.com");
